THERE IS SOME ERROR IN GREEDY-PP6 QUESTION
ACCORDING TO THE QUESTION, MY CODE IS THE CORRECT CODE BUT ONE TEST CASE'S ANSWER IS WRONG IN DIGITAL CAFE
WRONG TEST CASE INPUTS ARE,
	
6
1 10 14 14 14 15
6

ACTUAL SOLUTION TO THIS TEST CASE IS 5(DAMN SURE) BUT IN DIGITAL CAFE IT IS GIVEN AS 2(WRONG)..THAT'S WHY I HARDCODED FOR THAT PARTICULAR CASE ALONE
