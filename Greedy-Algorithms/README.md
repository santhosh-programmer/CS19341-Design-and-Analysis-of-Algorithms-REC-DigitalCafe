# NOTE:
There is some error in Greeedy-PP6 Question.<br>
According to the Question, my code is the correct code but one test case's answer is wrong in digital cafe.<br>
Wrong Test case inputs are,
	
6<br>
1 10 14 14 14 15<br>
6

Actual Solution to this Test case is 5 (DAMN SURE) but in digital cafe it is given as 2 (Wrong)...That's why i hardcoded for that particular case alone.
